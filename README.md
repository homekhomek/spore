# Spore
Spore was an app worked on by me and @Noise859 when we were in early high school. The idea behind spore was a competitive meme posting website, where you'd post memes on it and people would vote on them 1v1 style and be sorted by an elo algorithm.

We were very young so we didn't really finish it.
